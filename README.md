Sprinboard Student Project -- The Capstone Store. This is a simple online store, which is not fully functional. As a student I have learned
the following skills: 

1. Python
2.Flask 
Using API's 
Integrate Stripe API
Postgres Database,
Flask Libraries: SQLAlchemy, and may others


UI Experience
The UI allows customers to view and purchase things online --  the customer can add things to their cart,
and, once the customer is done, they can check-out and make a payment.

Administrator Dashboard UI

The administrator can log in to their section, log in and will be able to modify store products. The administrator
will be able to see orders and the order details. The administrator will be able to POST, PATCH, or DELETE a
product.
